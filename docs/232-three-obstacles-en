<h1 id="title">Three obstacles to awakening</h1>
<h3>When you need a breakthrough</h3>
<p>It is common for Zen practice that sooner or later the student comes up against an obstacle, which the teacher (by some skilful action) can help to overcome. Such cases are described in many stories: the teacher says or does something, and – bang! – the practitioner awakens.</p>
<p>The essence of this action is that it helps to let go of something.</p>
<p>There are no Zen monasteries in our country yet, there are few skilled teachers, and therefore most people practise on their own; you can not count on the teacher to shout at the right time: “Tsan!”, or to hit you with a stick, or to say something paradoxical – and you will let go of something and experience awakening.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is worthwhile to understand what obstacles prevent awakening and how to cope with them on your own.</p>
<h3>Three types of practitioners</h3>
<p>As Master Sheng Yen said, these obstacles are of two kinds: attachments and rigid views.</p>
<p>We can speak also about the third cause that obstructs the awakening: restlessness, agitation, anxiety. It also manifests as confusion, doubt, feeling mentally entangled.</p>
<p>Classical ways of Zen practice – sitting meditation, simple physical work and others – help to pacify the mind and tune it to calm contemplation.</p>
<p>Therefore, agitation does not stand out as a particular obstacle; we cope with it in the course of usual practice.</p>
<p>However, practising on their own, people often learn about Zen from books and underestimate the need for serenity; many “practitioners” (or people interested in Zen) remain very restless for years.</p>
<p>So, in order to efficiently remove the obstacles to awakening through your practice, pay attention to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agitation.</li>
<li>Rigid views.</li>
<li>Attachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>They correspond to “the three root poisons” (three main types of mental defilements, from which the other defilements also grow):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignorance (agitation and confusion).</li>
<li>Aversion (anger, hatred, accusations, negative labels).</li>
<li>Attachment (greed, artificial thirst).</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes people can be conventionally divided into three types – according to which of the three poisons prevails in their current life.</p>
<h3>Agitation</h3>
<p>How is agitation connected with ignorance – confusion, doubt, mental entanglement?</p>
<p>Often we can understand this intuitively, feeling: a person seems dumb because of internal anxiety.</p>
<p>Tensions prevent the brain from working freely. (Alexei Ukhtomsky explained this mechanism in detail in the doctrine of the dominant focus).</p>
<p>Calming and relaxing tensions help to develop clarity.</p>
<p>Therefore, in your practice, be sure to calm agitation and tensions in yourself, and help others to do the same.</p>
<h3>Rigid views</h3>
<p>Imagine a man who spent his whole life in caves. You come to him and say:</p>
<p>– Let's go outside!</p>
<p>He asks:</p>
<p>– What “outside”?</p>
<p>You say:</p>
<p>– Outside, there is freedom – walls are few, and there is no ceiling at all!</p>
<p>He says:</p>
<p>– Can you walk there?</p>
<p>– There you can walk, ride, swim, fly on airplanes…</p>
<p>He would say:</p>
<p>– Oh, liar! If you could walk there, it means there is floor. And if there is a floor, then there is a ceiling. There is no floor without a ceiling!</p>
<p>Many people are like that cave dweller. They draw some conclusions from their knowledge, and when your words do not correspond to those, they declare you a liar and do not want to hear any explanations.</p>
<p>This is called “clinging to rigid views.”</p>
<p>The person has proved something to himself and does not accept anything else – although his confidence is based on his ideas, and not on what is actually observed.</p>
<p>An antidote to such a state would be the understanding that your ideas are not the last instance. Your views may be limited. Therefore, it is worth not to rely on them completely, and not to reject other people's ideas at once, but each time to review everything with the new data.</p>
<p>In your practice, do not hold on to your knowledge, and take other people's opinions without prejudice. What is this knowledge based on, what is its sound grain? Develop awareness of your ideas and their causes. This will give you flexibility, and gradually you will learn not to cling even to the deepest delusions.</p>
<h3>Attachment</h3>
<p>If your practice stalled, that is a typical sign that you have bumped into some kind of attachment.</p>
<p>It may seem that it's hard to let go of an attachment, but in fact, the power of attachment and its very existence are conditioned by being limited.</p>
<p>Do you remember the advice of Tristan from “The Dog in the Manger”? Teodoro was in love with Marcela, and in order to break the enchantment of that love, Tristan gives Teodoro very clever advice, pretty similar to our course of actions in Buddhist practice. First, Teodoro should make a firm decision and do not stray from it; secondly, he should “Recall her vices, not her virtues.”</p>
<p>In a brilliant Russian movie, <a title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076732/" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076732/" rel="nofollow">Dog in the manger</a>, Tristan sings a <a title="https://youtu.be/9igBwpuU-cA?t=13m51s" href="https://youtu.be/9igBwpuU-cA?t=13m51s" rel="nofollow">funny song</a> “translating” various attractive traits of people into downsides: a slim one – “bones”, a kind one – “crank”, a gentle one – “sticky”, one with dignity – “scratch cat”, a generous one – “spender”, a sparing one – “cheapskate”, and so on.</p>
<p>This is very similar to the Buddhist approach. More precisely, the essence of the Buddhist approach is not that we deny the positive and pleasant sides of something. We realize them to the fullest, but we are not confined to them. Expanding our horizons, we are aware of other aspects of the situation. That makes our view balanced, without attachments. For example, while enjoying being with a loved one, we do not shield ourselves from the knowledge about the mortality of our bodies; so when we have to part, it will not be a “sudden” blow for us.</p>
<p>This is the awakened attitude: not to avoid joy, but also not to exaggerate it, not to cling to it, not to try to shield it from the inevitable reality by fictitious fences.</p>
<p>Attachment is caused by limited and exaggerated perceptions. By focusing only on positive aspects of something, or by presenting something as absolutely necessary, we deceive ourselves and create causes of suffering.</p>
<p>Widely known Buddhist practices for weakening attachments are the realization of mortality and meditation on unpleasant aspects of body (blood, pus, mucus, urine, fat, dirt, etc.) The meditation on the recognition of mortality is considered to be beneficial to all. It helps to not waste time in stupid ways.</p>
<p>Meditation on the unpleasant aspects of body can be harmful to those who are already very gloomy, with hypochondriacal view on the world. But for those who are addicted to the opposite sex, too attached to their bodies, etc., such meditation is useful.</p>
<p>For many practitioners, attachment creates an incorrect attitude towards Zen practice. They perceive the meditation session as a way to recharge pleasant sensations (“I practice!”), as a niche for escaping from real life.</p>
<p>At the beginning, it can be pretty natural: practicing during a meditation session, we actually recharge our energy, and we leave behind our usual habitual worries… And hardly could we change the rest of our life all at once, magically.</p>
<p>However, if we keep our practice in a separate niche, without trying to transform the rest of the life, then we will remain captive to attachments.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to realize that your intention is to transform your whole life. To be awakened not half an hour a day, on the pillow, but constantly.</p>
<p>All the practice and all the life must follow this intention: to be transformed into the space of freedom and wisdom. Meditation on the pillow is not an end in itself, not a refuge from concerns, but a means to awaken the whole world.</p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liberate yourself from uneasiness and tensions, and help others in that.</li>
<li>Take your views as possible hypotheses, not absolute truth.</li>
<li>Uncover and dissolve attachments. Spread the practice to all the life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Observe these three principles, and you will learn to let go of the obstacles to awakening.</p>
<p>So you could embody serenity, clear vision and pure intent, for the benefit of all.</p>
